This project implements a small webapp which performs basic text analytics on user submitted text.
The main.css and index.html files were provided by the Thinkful organization as part of the Challenge: Text Analyzer

The following files were modified:

index.html -> new CSS class were added for the DD tags.
app.js -> this file was delivered empty and has been created as part of the Thinkful challenge.

As it turns out the live version of the Thinkful app does not seem to work properly as it fails to account for the line breaks 
in the text area. 

In this version a sentence is considered a line in the text area.
